revision 1.7
date: 2005/07/08 01:27:19;  author: calbers;  state: Exp;  lines: +88 -69
* already implement \r\n removal with normalize-space() call.  Not an ideal
  solution because it will also collapse multiple spaces which might by semantically
  significant
* removed incorrect reference to source_citation_sub
* fixed source_citation_simple_obje reference to prevent interleave overlap
* corrected exact date checker
* Added Month checkers in relaxng where possible
* Changed the way the PHON tag was implemented.  It now works the way its supposed to
  1) Allowing only three PHON elements
  2) The can be placed anywhere in the event detail just as long as they are at the
     same level as the ADDR element (spec is not specific on this point, probably
     could implement it to make relaxng check to see if the next element after a
     closed ADDR element was a PHON element - but I chose the easier write, exploiting
     the ambiguity of the spec)
----------------------------
