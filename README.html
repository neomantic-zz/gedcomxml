>None of these proposals have gained widespread adoption, and GEDCOM 5.5 remains the format that nearly all genealogical programs export to and that users exchange their genealogical data using.</P
><P
>XML proponents can console themselves with the fact that the GEDCOM 5.5 standard has many of XML's features. Despite it's non-standard character set (Ansel), it is human-readable. Like XML elements, it also uses tags to delimit genealogical data; they precede the data. Finally, GEDCOM 5.5 tags can be nested under other tags, resembling XML's element's parent and child node trees. </P
><P
>Given these similarities, it is easy to envision a one-to-one translation of GEDCOM 5.5 into an XML format. GEDCOM 5.5 tags could be XML elements; XML's greater than &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; and less than &rsquo;&lt;&rsquo; characters could convert tags into elements, and these closed elements could delimit genealogical data. Kay's GedML comes close to proposing such a one-to-one translation. Many of GedML's XML elements correspond to GEDCOM 5.5 tags; e.g., INDI tags are simply &lt;INDI&gt; elements. However, other tags have been translated; e.g., SOUR tags are &lt;Source&gt; elements. Another difference between GedML and GEDCOM 5.5 is the absent &lt;TRLR&gt; element which is a required by GEDCOM 5.5 to indicate the end of a GEDCOM 5.5 file. This element is left out of the GedML proposal because the closed document root element makes it superfluous. Due to these differences, GedML is not a one-to-one translation of GEDCOM 5.5.</P

>Validating a GEDCOM 5.5 Document</H2
><P
>All XML schemas can be used for two purposes: providing guidance for how to write a valid XML document and testing if a XML document is &ldquo;welformed&rdquo; or &ldquo;valid.&rdquo; LDS's GEDCOM 5.5 standard already clearly describes how write genealogical data in marked up text files. Since the standard is not expressed in an XML schema, it cannot provide us a way to computationally determine if a GEDCOM 5.5 document is structured correctly. The schema in gedcom55xml.rng was written to fill that gap. If a GEDCOM 5.5 document can be converted into a GEDCOM 5.5 XML document, we have a way to check if the data is structured and formatted correctly by using gedcom55XML.rng; we have a way to test if the GEDCOM 5.5 tags are appropriately ordered and nested, and if the content of tags fits within the parameter described in the standard.</P
