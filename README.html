>The Church of the Latter Day Saints (LDS) has proposed the GEDCOM XML 6.0 Standard. This proposal represents a complete rewrite of GEDCOM 5.5 into XML markup. A DTD of this standard is published in the pdf <A

>documentation</A
>. An unofficial DTD has also been <A
HREF="http://members.cox.net/leebr/genealogy/GEDCOM60.dtd"
TARGET="_top"
>released</A
>. Considering that the LDS originally created the 5.5 standard, this was probably the best contender to replace GEDCOM 5.5. However, the numerous and often radical differences between the two standards renders the translation of old GEDCOM 5.5 data to new GEDCOM XML 6.0 data a non-trivial task.</P

>None of these proposals have gained widespread adoption, and GEDCOM 5.5 remains the format that nearly all genealogical programs export to and that users exchange their genealogical data using.</P
><P
>XML proponents can console themselves with the fact that the GEDCOM 5.5 standard has many of XML's features. Despite it's non-standard character set (Ansel), it is human-readable. Like XML elements, it also uses tags to delimit genealogical data; they precede the data. Finally, GEDCOM 5.5 tags can be nested under other tags, resembling XML's element's parent and child node trees. </P
><P
>Given these similarities, it is easy to envision a one-to-one translation of GEDCOM 5.5 into an XML format. GEDCOM 5.5 tags could be XML elements; XML's greater than &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; and less than &rsquo;&lt;&rsquo; characters could convert tags into elements, and these closed elements could delimit genealogical data. Kay's GedML comes close to proposing such a one-to-one translation. Many of GedML's XML elements correspond to GEDCOM 5.5 tags; e.g., <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>INDI</TT
> tags are simply <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>&lt;INDI&gt;</TT
> elements. However, other tags have been translated; e.g., <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SOUR</TT
> tags are <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>&lt;Source&gt;</TT
> elements. Another difference between GedML and GEDCOM 5.5 is the absent <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>&lt;TRLR&gt;</TT
> element which is a required by GEDCOM 5.5 to indicate the end of a GEDCOM 5.5 file. This element is left out of the GedML proposal because the closed document root element makes it superfluous. Due to these differences, GedML is not a one-to-one translation of GEDCOM 5.5.</P

>Ideally, this schema would re-represented 100 percent of the GEDCOM 5.5 standard in XML form. It, unfortunately, does not.

><P
>All XML schemas can be used for two purposes: providing guidance for how to write a valid XML document and testing if a XML document is &ldquo;welformed&rdquo; or &ldquo;valid.&rdquo; LDS's GEDCOM 5.5 standard already clearly describes how write genealogical data in marked up text files. Since the standard is not expressed in an XML schema, it cannot provide us a way to computationally determine if a GEDCOM 5.5 document is structured correctly. The schema in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>gedcom55XML.rng</TT
> was written to fill that gap. If a GEDCOM 5.5 document can be converted into a GEDCOM 5.5 XML document, we have a way to check if the data is structured and formatted correctly by using <TT
