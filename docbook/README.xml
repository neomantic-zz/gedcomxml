<title>RELAX NG/Schematron Schema for GEDCOM 5.5 XML (version 0.1)</title>
<author>
<firstname>Chad</firstname> <surname>Albers</surname></author></articleinfo><sect1>
<title>Background</title>
<para>The Church of the Latter-day Saints' <ulink url="http://homepages.rootsweb.com/~pmcbride/gedcom/55gctoc.htm">GEDCOM 5.5 Standard</ulink> provides a way to format, digitally store, and transfer genealogical data in a standardized, human readable text file. Over the years, new standards, using the <ulink url="http://www.w3.org/XML/">Extensible Markup Language (XML)</ulink>, have been proposed. The web page <ulink url="http://xml.coverpages.org/genealogy.html">here</ulink> provides a list of these proposals.</para>
<para>None of these proposals have gained widespread acceptance, and GEDCOM 5.5 remains the format that nearly all genealogical programs export to and that users still exchange their genealogical data using.</para><sect2>
<title>GEDCOM 5.5 XML</title>
<para>XML proponents can console themselves with the fact that the GEDCOM 5.5 standard bares some resemblance to a XML markup language. Despite its non-standard character set (Ansel), it is human readable text. Instead of XML elements, it delimits genealogical data between a text tag and character return and line feed or both; the tag precedes the data. Finally, GEDCOM 5.5 tags can be nested under other tags, resembling the parent and child node trees of XML elements. </para>
<para>Given these similarities, it is easy to envision an one-to-one translation of GEDCOM 5.5 into a XML language. GEDCOM 5.5 tags could be XML elements; XML's greater than &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; and less than &rsquo;&lt;&rsquo; characters could surround the tags, converting them into elements. Open and closed elements could delimit genealogical data. To differentiate it from other proposals, such a XML markup language could be called &ldquo;GEDCOM 5.5 XML.&rdquo;</para>
<para>Two XML markup languages have come close to describing GEDCOM 5.5 XML: GedML and GeniML.</para></sect2><sect2>
<title>GedML</title>
<para>In <ulink url="http://lists.xml.org/archives/xml-dev/199804/msg00282.html">1998</ulink>, Michael H. Kay proposed <ulink url="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/michael.h.kay/gedml/">GedML</ulink>. A XML Schema, a DTD, for this proposal was <ulink url="http://users.breathe.com/mhkay/gedml/dtd.html">released</ulink>. In GedML's DTD, most of the GEDCOM 5.5 tags have been translated into XML elements with the same name; e.g., <literal>INDI</literal> tags are simply <literal>&lt;INDI&gt;</literal> elements. Other tags, though, have been translated; e.g., <literal>SOUR</literal> tags are <literal>&lt;Source&gt;</literal> elements. GedML is also missing the <literal>&lt;TRLR&gt;</literal> element which replicates the GEDCOM 5.5 <literal>TRLR</literal> tag. This tag indicates the end of a GEDCOM 5.5 file. It is absent from GedML because the closed document root element, <literal>&lt;/GED&gt;</literal>, performs the same function, rendering a <literal>&lt;TRLR/&gt;</literal> element superfluous. Considering these differences, as far as the DTD is concerned, GedML is not an one-to-one translation of GEDCOM 5.5 into XML.</para>
<para>Kay, however, also released a Java language program that translates GEDCOM 5.5 files into XML documents. The markup language of these documents does not have a XML schema (DTD, W3C XML Schema, RELAX NG). However, a review of the output of his program reveals that all GEDCOM 5.5 tags have been translated to XML elements with the same name, just like GEDCOM 5.5 XML. There is, though, one missing element: the one corresponding to the <literal>TRLR</literal> tag. Given this flaw, this version of GedML also fails to be an one-to-one translation of GEDCOM 5.5 into XML.</para></sect2><sect2>
<title>GeniML</title>
<para>Jerry Fitzpatrick of Software Renovation Corporation developed <ulink url="http://www.softwarerenovation.com/igenie/GeniML.aspx">GeniML</ulink>. Like Kay, he released a Windows <ulink url="http://www.softwarerenovation.com/igenie/GeniMLConverter.zip">program</ulink> to convert GEDCOM 5.5 to XML. No schema for this markup language has been released. However, sample output included with the converter shows that GeniML appears to be an one-to-one translation of GEDCOM 5.5 into XML. GeniML even includes the <literal>&lt;TRLR&gt;</literal> element. There are, however, some differences; for example, GeniML delimits surname data using a <literal>&lt;SURNAME&gt;</literal> element, when GEDCOM 5.5 uses a <literal>SURN</literal> tag for the same purpose. Considering this difference and many others, GeniML, like GedML, is not an one-to-one translation of GEDCOM 5.5 into XML markup. </para></sect2></sect1><sect1>
<title>RELAX NG/Schematron Schema for GEDCOM 5.5 XML</title>
<para>GEDCOM 5.5 XML differentiates itself from GedML and GeniML because it attempts to replicate the LDS's GEDCOM 5.5 standard using XML markup. Without exception, all GEDCOM 5.5 tags should correspond to XML elements with the same name; all tags should be preserved; the parent-child relationships between the tags and elements should parallel one another; and all data delimited by the elements should fall within the strict guidelines of the standard.</para>
<para>To define GEDCOM 5.5 XML, a schema is needed. I am releasing one written in <ulink url="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/relax-ng/spec-20011203.html">RELAX NG</ulink>/<ulink url="http://www.schematron.com/">Schematron</ulink>. The RELAX NG XML version of the schema is contained in the file called &ldquo;<filename>gedcom55XML.rng</filename>&rdquo;. The RELAX NG <ulink url="http://relaxng.org/compact-20021121.html">compact syntax</ulink> version is in the file called &ldquo;<filename>gedcom55XML.rnc</filename>&rdquo;.</para>
<para>Like any XML schema, it can be used to validate, in the XML sense, a GEDCOM 5.5 file that has been converted to a GEDCOM 5.5 XML document; i.e., it can be used to determine if the document is both &ldquo;well-formed&rdquo; and &ldquo;valid.&rdquo; This means that it can be used to test if the GEDCOM 5.5 tags (when converted to XML elements) are correctly nested within each other as prescribed by the LDS's GEDCOM 5.5 standard. It can also be used to test if the data, delimited by the elements, follows the strict guidelines prescribed by the standard.</para><sect2>

<title>Schema Limitations</title>
<para>Ideally, the GEDCOM 5.5 XML RELAX NG/Schematron schema in <filename>gedcom55XML.rng</filename> would completely mirror the GEDCOM 5.5 standard. There are, however, nine places where it does not fully replicate the standard. This is why the version number of <filename>gedcom55XML.rng/c</filename> is &ldquo;0.1&rdquo;. When the schema captures 100 percent of the standard, the version number will be incremented to &ldquo;1.0&rdquo;.</para><orderedlist>
<listitem><para>The schema does not describe valid content of a GEDCOM 5.5 <literal>DATE_VALUE</literal>. The possible combinations of <literal>DATE_VALUE</literal>s are simply too numerous to handle using Schematron alone. The schema only prescribes that the length of character data of a <literal>DATE_VALUE</literal> be between 1 and 35 characters.</para></listitem><listitem><para>The schema does not describe all instances of <literal>EXACT_DATE</literal> data. It fails to describe the <literal>EXACT_DATE</literal> values of <literal>TRANSMISSION_DATE</literal> and <literal>CHANGE_DATE</literal>. When the Schematron rule is able to describe the <literal>EXACT_DATE</literal> value, it only uses the English <literal>MONTH</literal> abbreviations; i.e., <literal>JAN</literal>, <literal>FEB</literal>, <literal>MAR</literal>, etc..</para></listitem><listitem><para>Normally, the regions in the <literal>PLAC</literal> tag are separated by commas (e.g., Kansas City, Jackson County, Missouri, USA) or, alternatively, the delimiter specified in the <literal>HEAD.PLAC.FORM</literal> tag. <filename>gedcom55XML.rng</filename> ignores the delimiter of <literal>PLAC</literal> data.</para></listitem><listitem><para>The given name and surname of an individual are usually delimited in the <literal>NAME</literal> tag by forward slashes (e.g., Joseph/Smith/). The Schematron rules do not prescribe this format.</para></listitem><listitem><para>GEDCOM 5.5 allows for user-defined tags, even though it discourages their usage. The schema does not allow user-defined tags.</para></listitem><listitem><para>The schema does not describe the content of <literal>SOURCE_CITATION</literal>'s <literal>EVEN</literal> tag's <literal>EVENT_TYPE_CITED_FROM</literal>, even though the GEDCOM 5.5 standard specifies a restricted set of values. </para></listitem><listitem><para>It also does not describe the content of <literal>SOURCE_RECORD</literal>'s <literal>EVEN</literal> tag's <literal>EVENTS_RECORDED</literal>, even though again the GEDCOM 5.5 standard specifies a restricted set of values.</para></listitem><listitem><para>The <literal>AGE</literal> tag permits values such as <literal>CHILD</literal>, <literal>INFANT</literal>, <literal>STILLBORN</literal>, along with '<literal>y</literal>','<literal>m</literal>','<literal>d</literal>' which respectively signify year, month, and day. Following the specification strictly, these values should be case insensitive. In <filename>gedcom55XML.rng</filename>, they are case sensitive, defaulting to the lowercase values.</para></listitem><listitem><para>The <literal>MONTH</literal> values of <literal>DATE_EXACT</literal> should also be case insensitive, but in the current schema they are not. The defaults are the upper-case values.</para></listitem></orderedlist><para>Most of these shortcoming are due to difficulties in describing what would be considered, in XML terms, mixed-content elements.</para></sect2></sect1><sect1>

<title>Convert the GEDCOM 5.5 File to a GEDCOM 5.5 XML Document</title>
<para>Currently there is no quick and easy way to convert a GEDCOM 5.5 (or a .ged) file into a GEDCOM 5.5 XML (or .xml) file. I know of only one way to accomplish it now, and it requires some programming skills. To perform the conversion, you will need to use a Java program released by Michael Kay which, used with his famous <literal>saxon</literal> XML parser, will perform the conversion.</para><orderedlist>
<listitem><para>Download Kay's <ulink url="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/michael.h.kay/gedml/">source code</ulink> and unzip it in a location of your choosing. Remember the path to this location.

<title>Validate the GEDCOM 5.5 XML Document </title>
<para>Validating a XML file with a RELAX NG/Schematron schema is a complicated process. The complication arises because, to fully validate your GEDCOM 5.5 XML file using <filename>gedcom55XML.rng</filename>, a RELAX NG validator <emphasis>and</emphasis> a Schematron validator must be used. (The entire process is described <ulink url="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/02/11/relaxtron.html?page=5">here</ulink>). Two methods for validation are described below. </para><sect3>
<title>Method 1 - Simultaneously Validation</title>
<para>One way of validating a GEDCOM 5.5 XML file with <filename>gedcom55XML.rng</filename> is by using <ulink url="http://www.topologi.com">Topologi's</ulink> <ulink url="http://www.topologi.com/public/">Open Source Schematron Java classes</ulink>. Their zip file <ulink url="http://www.topologi.com/public/Schematron.zip">here</ulink> contains all the binaries and scripts needed to validate a XML file with Schematron rules embedded in RELAX NG patterns. To do so, type the following command in the directory called &ldquo;Schematron&rdquo; that is produced after unzipping the downloaded file above:</para><screen>
<![CDATA[java -cp ./Saxon/saxon.jar:./Java/Schematron.jar:./Jing/jing.jar com.topologi.schematron.EmbRNGValidator family.xml gedcom55XML.rng
]]></screen><para>When this command detects errors in <filename>family.xml</filename> using the RELAX NG schema, it stops at the first error and indicates the line it is on. You will need to correct the XML markup of <filename>family.xml</filename> (and the corresponding tags in <filename>family.ged</filename>), and then run the command above again to find the remaining errors using the RELAX NG schema.</para>
<para>After the command above reveals the error checked against the RELAX NG schema, it then proceeds to check the Schematron rules. When it finds an error, it will not tell you which line has a problem, but only the text of the problematic line. </para>
<para>In either the case of RELAX NG errors or Schematron errors, the command does not tell you what exactly is wrong with the line. It is up to you to figure out why the line is incorrect by referring to the LDS's GEDCOM 5.5 standard. </para></sect3><sect3>
<title>Method 2 - Sequentially Validation</title>
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>Validate the GEDCOM 5.5 XML file using the RELAX NG portion of the schema. </para><para>RELAX NG validation can be performed by a Open Source Java program called &ldquo;<literal>jing</literal>&rdquo;. This command line application can be downloaded <ulink url="http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/jing.html">here</ulink>. <literal>jing</literal> <ulink url="http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/jing-other.html">supposedly</ulink> can validate a XML file against the Schematron rules embedded in the RELAX NG schema. However, I have been unable to get <literal>jing</literal> to recognized the Schematron patterns in <filename>gedcom55XML.rng</filename>.</para>
<para>To perform the RELAX NG validation, type the following command line: </para><screen>
<![CDATA[java -jar [path-to-jing]/jing.jar gedcom55XML.rng family.xml
]]></screen><para>The results will pipe to the terminal's standard output. <literal>jing</literal> will report <emphasis>all</emphasis> the errors that it encounters. It will not report exactly what is wrong, but it will report what lines have errors in them. If <literal>jing</literal> reports no errors, your GEDCOM 5.5 XML document is valid, both in terms of its structure and most of its content.</para></listitem><listitem><para>Perform the Schematron validation. </para><para>Step one does not test the mixed-content inherent in the GEDCOM 5.5 (and GEDCOM 5.5 XML) object model. To test the mixed-content elements, the XML document must be tested against the Schematron rules in <filename>gedcom55XML.rng</filename>. It takes two steps to do so.</para><orderedlist>
<listitem><para>The Schematron rules must first be extracted from the RELAX NG schema using the style sheet, <filename>RNG2Schtrn.xsl</filename>, available <ulink url="http://www.topologi.com/public/Schtrn_XSD/RNG2Schtrn.zip">here</ulink>. For the sake of convenience, I have extracted the Schematron rules from <filename>gedcom55XML.rng</filename>. They are in the file called &ldquo;<filename>gedcom55XML.sch</filename>&rdquo;. I am distributing this source code under the GNU General Public License Version 2. </para></listitem><listitem><para>The <filename>family.xml</filename> file must be passed through the Schematron rules. To do so, we will use Topologoi's Schematron Java classes again, the same ones used in Method 1 above. Go to the &ldquo;Schematron&rdquo; directory again and type the following command:</para><screen>

]]></screen></listitem></orderedlist><para>If this command reveals any errors in <filename>family.xml</filename>, it will not tell you the line it occurs on, but it will indicate the data that fails to pass the Schematron rules.</para></listitem></orderedlist></sect3></sect2></sect1><sect1>
